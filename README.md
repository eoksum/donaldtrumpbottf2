# Team Fortress 2 - _Random Donald Trump Quotes Bot_
A bot for Team Fortress 2, programmed with Python, which sends random Donald Trump Quotes into game chat within a given interval of time. If you tend to be more annoying, we have a taunt option where bot taunts everytime it sends a Trump Quote into chat.

# NOT GUARANTEED
You **might** get banned from some servers, or in casual you might get vote-kicked.

# USAGE STEPS
**1-)** Change Team Fortress 2 keyboard layout and set Forward, Backward, Left and Right keystrokes to direction keys. With this setting, you can keep playing while sending constant Donald Trump Quotes into chat.

**2-)** Install Python3 _(If you don't have it already)_
After installing Python3, ensure you also have requests, pynput, keyboard libraries installed as well since we depend on them.
You can do this with a single command to CMD or Terminal:

**pip3 install requests pynput keyboard**

**3-)** Download this code

**4-)** Start Team Fortress 2, change display mode to windowed mode in settings *_(Sometimes Fullscreen also works fine. But bot is easier to manage on windowed mode)_*, change your name to **Random Donald Trump Quotes** , and finally, join a game.

**5-)** Execute the code from CMD if you run Windows. If you don't know how to start CMD ask Google.
You can set arguments to code. If you want to be annoying, add --taunt parameter to your code. You can also set a time interval for each message with --time *_IN SECONDS_* parameter.

**6-)** Play. Have fun and don't be too much annoying. You can run this on 'friendly' TF2 lobbies but it might be annoying on others. I wouldn't.

Thank you, and have fun.
